It's been a little over a month now since I've started my journey here on Flatiron. It's amazing how time flies. I realize that I've been doing a poor job at keeping up with my blog posts so my goal is to start posting more frequently. The most difficult lab for me in the HTML/CSS section of the course was the ZHW Shoe Layout lab. Every time I had got one of the elements where I wanted it positioned, it would mess up the next three elements. I must have went back and looked at the videos for layouts at least 5 times. I even grabbed a book on the subject just so I could get a better grasp on it. When it comes to styling elements there is so much to take into consideration that even the tiniest change in size of say the margin, or the width can totally mess up the look of the entire page. 

I know it's not something that one learns overnight. In fact it took me multiple nights. Just understanding the difference between a fixed element vs a fluid element, or an in-line vs block element took me weeks. I was introduced to the two languages briefly from a course on another website, but didn't delve too much into it. I clearly had not even graced the surface of what all you can do with HTML/CSS. I will say that even though learning about all of the layouts gave me somewhat of a headache, it did give me a greater appreciation for what goes into creating a website. There are so many small details and intricacies that go into a website that I had never even noticed. For instance after learning about media queries I actually find myself adjusting the size of my screen to see if the website I'm currently looking at is responsive or not (weird I know). I look forward to banging my head on the table over CSS layouts for years to come, and creating some awesome websites.
