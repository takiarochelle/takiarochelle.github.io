If someone were to have asked me 2 years ago if I saw myself wanting to learn how to code I would have said no. When I thought of coders I always had that picture of the super smart tech savy person, and that just wasn't me. I ended up getting my B.S. in Biology, and for a year I worked in retail until landing my current job in the lab of a biotech company. In the beginning I started off working mostly in the lab, but as time progressed I got the opportunity to work on little side projects here and there that required some coding. This is how I was first introduced to the command line and Python. I thought "hmmm this actually kind of interesting" and decided to take a couple of free online courses just to see if it was something I was interested in. After getting my feet wet a little I then made the decision to take a part-time Intro to Python class after work for 8 weeks. It was a scary thought at first because all these questions were going through my head like "what if I end up not liking this, or what if I'm not able to juggle both class and work?". Even though I had some reservations about enrolling I'm glad I did. It was a great experience and I got to meet a lot of awesome people who were just as interested in coding as I am. Our final project was creating a terminal game that we would present to the class on the last day. What stood out to me was that a lot of people did the exact same game, but everyone approached it differently and added their own flair. The whole process made me realize that this is something I enjoy doing and that I am capable of learning if I put the effort into it. That is how I ended up here at Flatiron.
